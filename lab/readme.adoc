## OpenShift - The Basics

Weâ€™re going to work through this https://github.com/yanaga/workshop-openshift-rbc[Guestbook] example. This example has a frontend using HTML5 and Javascript (client-side and server-side), and two microservices built using link:http://wildfly-swarm.io[WildFly Swarm] and link:http://vertx.io/[VertX]. It requires MySQL to store guestbook entries.
